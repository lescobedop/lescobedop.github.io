Green Street Holdings was founded with a powerful belief: that small businesses are the heart of thriving communities. We invest in local businesses that solve problems and provide great serviceâ€”businesses that are not just valuable, but essential to building wealth and long-term prosperity.

Many small business owners plan to run their businesses for life, but when the time comes, we help ensure their legacy is preserved through a seamless transition. By investing in these businesses, we support the entrepreneurs who drive local economies, fostering growth, stability, and community.

Our mission is clear: to empower the people behind the businesses that keep communities strong and vibrant, and to help create legacies that last for generations.
