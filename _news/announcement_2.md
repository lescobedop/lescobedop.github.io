Hey everyone,

I'm thrilled to finally unveil my official website!

For years, I've been fortunate to work with incredible teams, build impactful businesses, and contribute to the growth of organizations across diverse sectors. Now, I'm excited to share my journey, insights, and perspectives with a wider audience.

On my website, you'll find information about my professional background, including my current role at ADP and my entrepreneurial ventures:

- **Green Street Holdings:** Where we invest in and support the backbone of our communities – small businesses.
- **Kipu:** A boutique data and AI consultancy dedicated to helping organizations unlock their full potential through data-driven strategies.

You can also learn a bit about me outside of work – my passion for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, my commitment to continuous improvement, and my belief in the power of collaboration.

I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals, explore new opportunities, and contribute to meaningful conversations. Please, feel free to add me to your network via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luchoescobedo/) or send me a message at [contact@luchoescobedo.com](mailto:contact@luchoescobedo.com)

I invite you to explore my website and feel free to reach out if you see an area of alignment or simply want to connect.

Best regards,

Lucho Escobedo
