Hi, I’m Lucho Escobedo, a data-driven leader with a passion for innovation and business transformation. As Head of Data at ADP, I lead initiatives that optimize operations, improve customer experiences, and boost revenue, generating millions in value and demonstrating the power of data leadership.

Beyond my corporate role, I co-founded two ventures. Kipu, a boutique consulting firm, specializes in data and AI, offering strategic consulting, AI/ML development, team building, and workshops to deliver impactful results. Green Street Holdings focuses on acquiring and investing in high-growth companies, fostering strong fundamentals, and guiding organizations to success through tailored partnerships.

With over 15 years of experience in technology and management consulting, I bring a unique mix of data expertise, business strategy, and leadership. My career includes roles at McKinsey & Company and REEF Technology, where I created scalable data solutions and led innovation.

Outside of work, I pursue strength training and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, embracing the discipline of continuous improvement—whether in the gym, on the mat, or in business.

If you see alignment or think I can help, feel free to reach out. Let’s create something extraordinary together!
