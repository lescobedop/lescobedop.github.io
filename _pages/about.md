Hi, my name is Lucho Escobedo‚Äîan entrepreneur, technologist, and investor, driven by the idea that success begins with clarity and discipline. My work lives at the intersection of business, operational rigor, and the thoughtful use of data and technology.

For almost 20 years, I‚Äôve led global teams and scaled enterprise platforms, delivering $400M+ in business impact. Beyond corporate roles, I‚Äôve focused my life on something broader: helping small and mid-sized businesses grow stronger, modernize with purpose, and build the resilience needed to navigate change and thrive.

Through Green Street Holdings, I support companies through acquisitions, partnerships, and capital investments‚Äîguiding growth, modernization, and long-term resilience. With Kipu, I advise organizations on how to design and scale their technology strategies, especially in data and AI. I believe in creating structures that last, aligning teams around what matters, and building systems that evolve with purpose.

Outside of work, I train in Brazilian jiu-jitsu‚Äîgrounded in focus, humility, and continuous improvement, all of which shape how I work, collaborate, and grow with others.

If our paths align or you think I can help, feel free to reach out. Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together.
