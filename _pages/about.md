Hi, my name is Lucho Escobedo. I build and support businesses that thrive on clarity, discipline, and intelligent systems‚Äîwhether through strategy, technology, or long-term investment. My work centers on helping organizations grow with intent and adapt with resilience.

For almost 20 years, I‚Äôve led global teams and scaled enterprise platforms, delivering $400M+ in business impact. Beyond corporate roles, I‚Äôve focused my life on something broader: helping small and mid-sized businesses grow stronger, modernize with purpose, and withstand change with confidence.

Through Green Street Holdings, I support companies through acquisitions, partnerships, and capital investments‚Äîguiding growth, modernization, and long-term resilience. With Kipu, I advise organizations on how to design and scale their technology strategies, especially in data and AI. I believe in creating structures that last, aligning teams around what matters, and building systems that evolve with purpose.

Outside of work, I train in Brazilian jiu-jitsu‚Äîgrounded in focus, humility, and continuous improvement, all of which shape how I work, collaborate, and grow with others.

If our paths align or you think I can help, feel free to reach out. Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together.
